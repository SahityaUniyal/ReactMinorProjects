# Password Generator

A simple and customizable password generator built with React.

## Introduction

This project is a password generator created using React. It allows users to generate random passwords with varying lengths and includes options for including numbers and special characters.

## Features

- Generate random passwords
- Adjustable password length
- Option to include numbers and special characters
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard

## Code Description

The code is organized into a React functional component (`App.js`) with the following key sections:

- **State Management (`useState`)**: The `useState` hook is used to create state variables (`length`, `numAllowed`, `charAllowed`, `password`) that manage the dynamic behavior of the password generator.

- **Password Generation (`useCallback`)**: The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `passwordGenerator` function. This ensures that the function is only recreated when its dependencies (length, numAllowed, charAllowed) change, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Clipboard Copy (`useRef`)**: The `useRef` hook is used to create references (`passwordRef` and `copyRef`) for the password input field and the copy button. These references are later used to interact with the DOM elements, such as selecting text in the input field and applying styling to the copy button.

- **Regenerate Password (`useEffect`)**: The `useEffect` hook is utilized to regenerate the password whenever relevant state variables (length, numAllowed, charAllowed) change, ensuring that the password stays in sync with the user's preferences.

- **User Interface**: The UI is built using React components with responsive styling using Tailwind CSS.
